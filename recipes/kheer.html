    <h2>Description</h2>  
    <p>A sweet, fragrant rice pudding that satisifes your sweet tooth and also offers a reprieve after a spicy dish!</p>
    <p>A labour of love for sure as easy as it is to cook, it does take a bit of time; all is fair I say, and worth it :D</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            1/3 cup soaked basmati rice
        </li>
        <li>
            1/2 cup sugar 
        </li>
        <li>
            1/4 cup water
        </li>
        <li>
            5 cups whole milk   
        </li>
        <li>
            5 or 6 caradamom pods
        </li>
        <li>
            1/2 tbsp crushed pistachios
        </li>
        <li>
            1/2 tbsp almond silvers
        </li>
        <li>
            3 - 4 drops Kewra food flavour (rose water is also A-OK)
        </li>
        <li>
            crushed pistachio and almonds, for garnish
        </li>
    </ul> 
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Add water and milk in a heavy-bottomed pot, and let it simmer.
        </li>
        <li>
            Once boiling, add in the drained soaked rice (you can soak the rice for about 30 minutes).
        </li>
        <li>
            Gradually add in the sugar and keep stirring.
        </li>
        <li>
            Wait for the milk to get concentrated (it gets a bit yellow) and crush the cardamom seeds in a powder-like texture and add it.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the almonds and pistachios, and keep cooking until the rice gets soft enough to get easily mushed by your fingers.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the kewra/rose water food flavour.
        </li>
        <li>
            Lightly blend the rice pudding mixture with a blender to better incoportate the rice and milk, and to thicken the mixture, don't blend it to a paste-like consistency but more of a gritty texture.
        </li>
        <li>
            Turn the heat to low, and let it cook until it thickens to however you prefer.
        </li>
        <li>
            Turn off the heat, and let it cool.
        </li>
        <li> Add the garnish for an extra crunch! </li>
        <li>
            Serve it in bowls and boom! done! Wipe the sweat off your forehead and pat yourself on the back. You've done it!
        </li>
    </ol>
