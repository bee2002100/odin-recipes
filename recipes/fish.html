    <h1>Bengali Fried Rohu Fish</h1>
    <img src="fish.jpg" alt="image of pieces of fried fish decorated with onions, lemons and chilli" width="25%"></img>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A delicious and easy fish fry recipe, considered a household staple amongst Bengalis! Also called rui, but in English-speaking countries it'd
        do you well to just ask for carp :-)
    </p>
    <p>A dish that can also be eaten for lunch, dinner or maybe (if you're brave enough) breakfast too, not too spicy nor too boring; I do see the vision, you'll have to keep the windows closed for a while though.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            400 GM fish fillet
        </li>
        <li>
            2 tbsp turmeric powder

        <li>
            1 tsp black pepper
        </li>
        <li>
            1 tsp red chilli powder
        </li>
        <li>
            1/2 tsp coriander powder
        </li>
        <li>
            Oil <i>for frying</i>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Wash the fish thoroughly.
        </li>
    <li>
        In a big bowl, add all the spices together.
    </li>
    <li>
        Add in the fish, and coat it thoroughly with the spices.
    </li>
    <li>
        Let it marinate for about 30 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
        Heat up the oil on a frying pan until high temperature, or until you feel its heat.
    </li>
    <li>
        Slowly add in the fish pieces one-by-one.
    </li>
    <li>
        Let it cook and build a solid crisp cover on one side, and then turn it around and do the same.
    </li>
    <li>
        Take it out and place it on a kitchen towel <b>or</b> a bunch of tissue papers to soak up the oil.
    </li>
    <li>
        Garnish with onion and lemon slices if needed.
    </li>
    <li>
